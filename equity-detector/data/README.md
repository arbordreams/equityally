## Training Data (`training/`)

Datasets used to train the BERT model.

**Main Dataset:**
- Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge
  - 120,000+ labeled comments
  - 6 toxicity categories
  - Multi-label classification data

**Additional Sources** (not included in repo):
- Wikipedia Talk Pages
- Twitter toxicity datasets
- Civil Comments
- Q&A forum data

**Documentation:** See `training/README.md`

## Data Usage

### For End Users
Use the sample files in `samples/` to test bulk analysis:
1. Navigate to **üîç Detector** page
2. Select **Bulk Analysis** tab
3. Upload a sample CSV file
4. View results and download analyzed data

### For Developers
Access training data in `training/` for:
- Model evaluation
- Performance benchmarking
- Additional fine-tuning
- Research and analysis

---

## CSV Format Requirements

All CSV files for bulk analysis must follow this format:

```csv
text
"First message here..."
"Second message here..."
...
```

**Requirements:**
- Must have a `text` column header
