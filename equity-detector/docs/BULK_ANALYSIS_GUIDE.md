# Bulk Analysis Guide - EquityLens

## Overview
The Bulk Analysis feature allows you to analyze multiple text entries at once from CSV or Excel files, providing comprehensive statistics, visualizations, and downloadable results.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prepare Your Data File

Your CSV or Excel file should contain:
- **Required**: A column with text content to analyze
- **Optional**: An ID or name column for tracking individual entries

#### Supported File Formats
- `.csv` - Comma-separated values
- `.xlsx` - Excel workbook (2007+)
- `.xls` - Excel workbook (legacy)

#### Example CSV Structure
```csv
id,text,author
1,"Great job on the presentation!",User123
2,"You're such an idiot.",User456
3,"Thanks for the helpful info.",User789
```

### 2. Upload and Configure

1. Navigate to the Detector page
2. Select "üìä Upload CSV/Bulk Analysis" as your input method
3. Upload your file using the file uploader
4. Preview the first 5 rows to verify the upload
5. Select the column containing text to analyze
6. Optionally select an ID/Name column for tracking

### 3. Run Analysis

Click "üîç Analyze All Entries" to start the batch analysis. The system will:
- Filter out empty or very short texts (< 5 characters)
- Show a progress bar during analysis
- Process each entry through the BERT model
- Calculate risk scores and classifications

## Features

### üí° Key Insights

Automated insights generation including:
- Overall safety assessment
- High-risk entry count and recommendations
- Moderate-risk entry identification
- Uncertainty warnings (when using Monte Carlo Dropout)

#### Alert Levels
- **‚úÖ Overall Positive**: < 25% concerning content
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate Concern**: 25-50% concerning content
- **üö® High Alert**: > 50% concerning content

## Advanced Options

### Monte Carlo Dropout for Bulk Analysis

Enable Monte Carlo Dropout in the Advanced Options section before running analysis:

**Benefits:**
- More robust predictions through ensemble averaging
- Uncertainty quantification for each entry
- Better identification of borderline cases

**Considerations:**
- Increases processing time (multiply by number of passes)
- Recommended for critical applications
- 20-30 passes recommended for balance

**Example Processing Times:**
- Standard: ~0.1-0.3s per entry
- MC Dropout (20 passes): ~2-6s per entry

## Use Cases

### 1. Social Media Monitoring
- Analyze user comments for toxicity
- Identify concerning patterns
- Prioritize moderation efforts

### 2. Community Management
- Review forum posts in bulk
- Track community health metrics
- Generate periodic safety reports

### 3. Content Moderation Queue
- Process moderation queue efficiently
- Flag high-risk content automatically
- Focus human review on borderline cases

### 4. Research and Analysis
- Study content patterns over time
- Compare different communities or platforms
- Validate moderation strategies

### 5. Compliance Reporting
- Generate safety compliance reports
- Document moderation efforts
- Track improvement metrics

## Best Practices

### Data Preparation
1. **Clean Your Data**: Remove duplicate entries, empty cells
2. **Text Length**: Ensure entries have sufficient content (> 5 characters)
3. **Encoding**: Use UTF-8 encoding for special characters
4. **File Size**: For large datasets (> 1000 entries), consider splitting into batches

### Analysis Strategy
1. **Start Small**: Test with 10-50 entries first
2. **Review Threshold**: Use filters to focus on concerning content
3. **Context Matters**: Remember AI isn't perfect - review high-risk items manually
4. **Track Trends**: Use regular bulk analysis to monitor changes over time

### Interpreting Results

#### Risk Score Interpretation
- **0-50%**: Low risk - Generally safe content
- **30-70%**: Moderate - Worth monitoring and contextual review
- **80-90%**: High risk - Review recommended
- **90-100%**: Very high risk - Immediate review needed

#### When to Use MC Dropout
- Critical applications requiring high confidence
- Borderline cases need careful evaluation
- Research requiring uncertainty metrics
- When false positives are costly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**File Upload Fails**
- Ensure file is valid CSV or Excel format
- Check file isn't corrupted or password-protected
- Try saving as CSV if using Excel

**No Valid Entries Found**
- Check text column has actual content
- Ensure text length > 5 characters
- Verify column selection is correct

**Slow Processing**
- Expected for large datasets
- Consider disabling MC Dropout for speed
- Split large files into smaller batches

**Unexpected Classifications**
- Remember: context matters
- AI can misinterpret sarcasm, quotes
- Always review high-stakes decisions manually
- Consider cultural and linguistic nuances

## Sample Data

A sample CSV file (`sample_data.csv`) is included with 20 entries mixing safe and concerning content. Use this to test the bulk analysis feature.

## Privacy & Security

- All analysis runs locally on your device
- No data is sent to external servers (BERT model)
- OpenAI API only used if you enable AI Assistant features
- Downloaded results stay on your local machine

## Technical Details

- **ROC-AUC**: 96.8% (excellent discrimination)
- **F1 Score**: 58.1% (balanced precision-recall)
- **Linear scaling**: Performance scales linearly with number of entries
- **Monte Carlo Dropout**: Uncertainty quantification + ensemble averaging
