- Recommended next steps
- How to handle edge cases
- Escalation procedures

#### General Knowledge
- Cyberbullying statistics
- AI/ML concepts
- Content safety research
- Platform-specific guidance

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Analysis Question
**User:** "Why was this flagged as concerning?"  
**AI:** *Provides detailed explanation based on current analysis context*

### Example 2: Technical Question
**User:** "How does isotonic calibration improve accuracy?"  
**AI:** *Explains calibration process, benefits, and improvement metrics*

### Example 3: Guidance Question
**User:** "What should I do if this is a false positive?"  
**AI:** *Provides actionable recommendations for handling false positives*

### Example 4: Model Question
**User:** "How does the model work?"  
**AI:** *Explains BERT architecture, training, and inference process*

## System Prompt

The AI assistant uses a comprehensive system prompt that includes:

### Equity Ally Facts
- Model architecture: BERT-base-uncased, 110M parameters, 418MB
- Performance: 96.8% accuracy (isotonic calibration)
- Training: 120,000+ samples from 5 datasets
- Privacy: Completely offline, on-device processing
- Features: Monte Carlo Dropout, GPT-4o-mini validation layer

### Response Guidelines
- Adjust technical depth to match question
- Be clear, accurate, and educational
- Provide context about current analysis
- Reference specific metrics when relevant

## Implementation Code

### Chat Interface (Simplified)
```python
# Initialize chat history
if 'ai_chat_history' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.ai_chat_history = []

# User input
user_question = st.text_input("Your question:", placeholder="...")

# Submit button
if st.button("üöÄ Ask AI"):
    if user_question:
        # Add context about current analysis
        context = f"Text analyzed with {prob_bullying*100:.1f}% risk"
        
        # Get AI response
        answer = chat_about_model(user_question, context=context)
        
        # Save to history
        st.session_state.ai_chat_history.append({
            'question': user_question,
            'answer': answer
        })

# Display conversation history
for chat in reversed(st.session_state.ai_chat_history):
    st.markdown(f"‚ùì {chat['question']}")
    st.markdown(f"ü§ñ {chat['answer']}")
```

## Session State Management

### Two Separate Chat Histories
1. **`ai_chat_history`** - Used during active analysis
2. **`ai_chat_history_standalone`** - Used for persistent results

This prevents conflicts when users navigate away and return.

## Benefits

### 1. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Users can ask custom questions
- Get immediate, context-aware answers
- Learn more about the model and results
- Better understanding of content moderation

### 2. **Educational Value**
- Teaches users about AI and content safety
- Provides best practices guidance
- Explains technical concepts accessibly
- Builds trust through transparency

### 3. **Flexibility**
- Not limited to pre-defined responses
- Can handle follow-up questions
- Adapts to user's knowledge level
- Covers wide range of topics

### 4. **Context Integration**
- AI knows about current analysis
- References specific probabilities
- Relates answers to the analyzed text
- Provides targeted guidance

## Cost Considerations

### GPT-4o Pricing (as of Oct 2024)
- **Input:** ~$2.50 per 1M tokens
- **Output:** ~$10.00 per 1M tokens
- **Estimated cost per chat:** ~$0.01-0.03 (1-3 cents)

### Example Usage Costs
- 100 questions/day = ~$1-3/day
- 1,000 questions/day = ~$10-30/day
- Higher quality than GPT-4o-mini, comparable to GPT-4

## Security & Privacy

### API Key Handling
- Stored only in session state (not persisted)
- Never logged or saved to disk
- User must provide their own key
- Validated before use

### Data Privacy
- Chat history stored only in browser session
- Cleared when page refreshes
- No server-side storage
- BERT analysis still runs 100% offline

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ‚úÖ Chat interface displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Questions submit successfully
- ‚úÖ Answers display properly
- ‚úÖ Context is included in AI responses
- ‚úÖ Chat history persists during session
- ‚úÖ Clear button works
- ‚úÖ Handles empty input gracefully
- ‚úÖ Works in both contexts (active & standalone)

### Example Questions to Test
1. "Why was this flagged?"
2. "What does isotonic calibration do?"
3. "How accurate is the model?"
4. "What should I do next?"
5. "How does BERT work?"

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
